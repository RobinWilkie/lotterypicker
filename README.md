# lotterypicker

This was a project I undertook to practice my javaScript skills. 
I wanted to produce a lottery numbers generator based on the UK lottery (numbers 1-59). 
I used javaScript so that when the button is clicked each ball is populated by a random number between 1 and 59, 
no number could be repeated, the numbers were sorted in ascending order and a CSS animation was triggered at the same time. 
The next stage of this application is to produce a native app and to look into storing the generated numbers locally.
